						<p>
							Welcome to my personal portfolio. This page my thought processes as well as reasoning behind the setup and designs displayed throughout the website. I chose to make this portfolio based off my art, as well as the things I have learned throughout the Web Design courses that I have taken in the past couple years. This design and topic decision was to have my portfolio displayed and obtain as many critiques as well as tips to further improve my portfolio, to be able to show this with pride when applying to web design positions. <br><br>
							
							Setting this up can also help me demonstrate my abilities as a web/UI/UX designer, so I could show employers that I am not only relatively skilled in art, but also capable enough to figure out formatting as well as making rational design based choices with HTML and CSS. <br><br>
							
							Below shows my portfolio based on the material I have learned in my first time being exposed to web design. The knowledge I had after finishing the first year course was extremely limited, and I knew that I had to fix my portfolio with the newly obtained skills, as well as research, to improve my website to be presentable.

							<img src="images/old-2602.JPG" class="process-img12" alt="260 website about me page">
							
							**Excuse the slightly broken images, a bit of the file got lost, but you get the general layout, haha.**
							
						</p>
						
						<a id="preliminary"><h3 class="process-title">Preliminary planning</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							At first, the 5 pages was going to be: gallery as my homepage, shop, resume, about, and contact. I wanted to do this because I saw a couple of artist websites show their work right off the bat. This lets the user get right into it, the purpose of the website, which was to look at my art and what I have to offer. I wanted to integrate a shop into my website, to provide a service for customers who wanted to buy merch. Resume, about, and contact were really just standard things for online portfolios.<br><br>
							<img src="images/hannahHome.JPG" class="process-img12" alt="Hannah's homepage">
							<img src="images/yuumeiHome.JPG" class="process-img12" alt="Yuumei's hompage">
							<img src="images/loishNav.JPG" class="process-imgR" alt="Loish's navbar">
							<img src="images/hannahNav.JPG" class="process-imgR" alt="Hannah's navbar">
							<img src="images/kelogNav.JPG" class="process-imgR" alt="Kelogsloops' navbar">
							
							A lot of my page layouts and inspirations came from <a href="https://kelogsloops.com/" class="cv-links">Kelogsloops</a>, an Australian artist who I’ve been following for an EXTREMELY long time, <a href="https://loish.net/" class="cv-links">Loish</a>, another very talented artist, <a href="https://www.yuumeiart.com/" class="cv-links">Yuumei</a>, and my friend’s website, <a href="https://www.kim-illustrations.com/" class="cv-links">Hannah</a>. <br><br>

							I really liked how most of them had the navigation bar on the left-hand side, in a fixed position. Because this type of website has a lot of scrolling, I chose to also make it fixed because it would make navigation a lot easier if the user didn’t have to scroll all the way back up to the top. While I could’ve made the navigation bar fixed at the top, I prefer not to squish the screen, giving the user a squished and contained feeling because of the shortened display, especially since many of my artworks were in a portrait orientation.<br><br>
							
							I also really liked how they all featured a small piece of an original artwork at the top of the navigation menu, which was a link back to the homepage. This not only gives a simple sample of what to expect, but it really helps with the general vibes to an artist webpage/portfolio. This image changes when it’s on a smaller screen, a simpler version, something that would be easier to see and distinguish despite having a smaller screen. <br><br>
							
							Now here was my dilemma: should I have made the navbar sticky, attached to the top of the screen. I chose not to. Because this was made for a smaller screen, it would be most likely used on a phone or tablet. The browser apps already have a built-in feature, where you tap near the top of the browser would bring you to the top of the page. This eliminates reducing the display/viewport.
						</p>
						
						<a id="beginning"><h3 class="process-title">beginning stages</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							While I was thinking about it more, I felt the need to change up some of the pages. I decided not to put a shop page, and a resume. For the shop page, I felt like it wouldn’t exactly fit a webpage I wanted to use as a portfolio. While it could have been something useful to show, that I came make merch, etc, I felt like this isn’t the primary goal and would distract the users from the original purpose. It also felt sort of redundant, in terms of page-typologies. Because it would’ve been mostly merch, which required images, this shopping page would be far too similar to a photo-rich page, so I decided to remove this page. Resume and CV are VERY similar, except I didn’t want to put the information I normally put on a resume to be on a possible public website. While a resume is still something useful, I would rather call it a CV to list a longer and more detailed display of my experiences, where a resume would not technically have the room to show. While I TECHNICALLY don’t have as many experiences / information to put on it, I wanted to plan and strive to be able to add more length to my CV.  <br><br>
							
							Honestly, I wasn’t sure where to put the carousel that would make sense other than putting in on the homepage, where it could feature three of the main pages. I wanted the homepage to be relatively simple, as I have learned that throwing a ton of information to the user that just entered the site isn’t an ideal process, so I just kept it to one thing, the carousel.
							The colour scheme of my website is quite plain, with minimal colours for two reasons:<br><br>
							
							1. Since this is an art portfolio, most of the focus should be dedicated to the art itself, any extravagant detailing/designing will distract the users from the art. Also because of the different art styles and different colour schemes, it would be hard to coordinate everything to look smooth and united, so a very toned down, minimalistic colour palette is used.<br><br>
							
							2. The colour palette matches the little illustrations on the navigation bars, to somewhat unite them and not also distract too much with different colours all over the place. <br><br>
						
							The navigation changed from the left-hand side to a drop-down menu at the top to be mobile friendly
						</p>

						<p>
							<img src="images/yuumeiHover.JPG" class="process-imgR2" alt="yuumeiart's hover styling">
							Originally, I used rows and columns instead of the grid system, but because I had an odd number of rows, when I reduced the size of the display port, it turned into 2 columns, where one had double the amount of the other, which made me switch to using the masonry display by bootstrap, to create a more evenly distributed look. <br><br>
							
							The hover effect on each image was 100% inspired by Yuumeiart’s hover effect. I loved the simplicity of it, as well as it displaying the title. I chose to add the filter on top to create more contrast between the text and the image itself.<br><br> 
							
							Originally, I had all my images together, sorting them but a sort of gradient system in colours so that there was a smooth flow. But because this page has many images, I created a sort of separate navigation system so that it does the smooth scrolling. Pressing it brings the user down to the labelled category. <br><br>
							
							The lightbox feature by <a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" class="cv-links">Lokesh Dhakar</a> was also extremely useful, as I wasn't sure how I could display the images larger when clicked upon, other than to literally take the user to a new page, where they have to press back, when it could be easily displayed, and then easily gone through using the functions of this code (by pressing the next arrows on the sides of the image).

						</p>
					
						<a id="about"><h3 class="process-title">about page process</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							There isn’t much about this page. I just made the width of the container smaller, as I have learned that a long, continuous line of words and letters isn’t the most user-friendly way to display text, so I kept the length of the lines relatively short, putting images here and there to shorten it. 
						</p>
					
						<a id="cv"><h3 class="process-title">cv page process</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							<img src="images/kelogCV.JPG" class="process-imgR2"  alt="kelogsloops' CV page layout">
							This page was inspired by the layout of the cv page from kelogsloops. Originally, I had planned for the titles of the sections to be the same orange behind the character to add an extra feature so that users have an easier time to distinguish between the titles, but then I realized that it didn’t follow the accessibility of WCAG. So, I opted to changing it to just simple dark grey on an off-white background. However, I wanted to keep the colour a bit, so I used it as the line that separates each section.<br><br>
							
							I also added the feature of underlining some text, to indicate that it’s a clickable link for users who were curious about the topic. Although it’s somewhat noticeable, I added the hover background colour change to make it a more distinctive feature when hovered, as an extra layer noticeability?
						</p>
					
						<a id="contact"><h3 class="process-title">contact page process</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							This just had the bootstrap form layout; I took some stuff out because it had a lot of unneeded stuff. I made it relatively the same as the contact page on almost every art page. I thought adding more was unnecessary, so I just kept it simple.<br><br>
							
							The only different thing was the gif at the top. I originally had the text going across the whole screen, but again, not the most accessible thing to do, so I used a gif that I remembered that I had laying around that I made earlier this year and slapped it on the left half of the container. Thought it would be a pretty good addition to the page, because it sort of represents me working away! (Although it’s not meant to be me in the drawing, but a friend, but no one needs to know that.)<br><br>
							
							I made every field in the form required to be filled out, as everything there is pretty standard and required, and stops users from accidentally sending a message before they included everything they needed. The only thing that may not technically need to be filled out is the last name, but due to the professionalism, I’d prefer to know their entire name rather than just addressing them by their first name. I could’ve left it as one single field, but I don’t know what it’s like everywhere else in the world, some last names could come before first and I’d rather not risk the chance of addressing them with the wrong name. 
						</p>
						
						<a id="final"><h3 class="process-title">final edits and tweaks</h3></a>
						
						<p>
							Decided to change the table of contents from the top of the gallery to just be an addition to the side sticky navigation -- I really liked how it looked on Kelogloops' navigation seection, and thought I should just group everything together rather than splitting extremely similar functions up. <br><br>
							
							Previously, I had the navigation bar as a box floating on the left, with 50px margins on the left and top. Then I realized that it was wasting a lot of space, and it didn't have enough space for the formatting I wanted (sub navigations on the gallery and process page), so I decided to just push it against the left side, as well as making the height 100%, as a sticky  navigation. <br><br>
							
							I decided to also not include any placeholder text. Placeholder text are words within the text the field with low contrast, but this may cause an issue with those who have a visual impairment, so I opted to adding the text next to the field titles with normal contrast.
